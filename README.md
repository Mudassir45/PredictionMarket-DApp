# Prediction Market DApp
A prediction market is a place to buy and sellâ€¦predictions. Or to be precise, shares in predictions.

## Real World Use Case:
- Prediction markets can help forecast any verifiable outcome whether political elections, the weather, economic growth, housing prices etc.
- Prediction markets on real-world events contain uncertainty, market actors with differing information, views and intuitions, and any number of factors that may affect the outcome.
- Prediction markets not only extract existing knowledge but motivate the production of new knowledge. For example, prediction markets on the weather might motivate meteorologists to develop improved forecasting models.
